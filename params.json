{"name":"Pinocchio","tagline":"Automate behavior testing for Puppet modules using Cucumber + Vagrant.","body":"# Pinocchio\r\n\r\nAutomating real behavior testing of your Puppet modules with Cucumber, Vagrant, and a little magic.\r\n\r\n## Why Test\r\n\r\nBecause you're writing code, believe it or not.\r\n\r\n### Isn't This Just Cucumber-Puppet? Someone Already Wrote That\r\n\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### But I Already Have Rspec-Puppet\r\n\r\nTim Sharpe did the entire Puppet community a great service by bringing us `rspec-puppet`. But it only covers one side of the story...\r\n\r\n## Anatomy Of A Puppet Run\r\n\r\n1. Catalog Compile\r\n  - Executed on master\r\n  - Validates syntax\r\n  - Performs hiera lookups\r\n  - Builds resource dependency graph\r\n  - Renders ERB templates\r\n2. Implementation\r\n  - Executed on agent\r\n  - checks state of each resource\r\n  - remediates if necessary\r\n  - actually runs provider code\r\n\r\n## Installation\r\n\r\nYou can't install pinocchio from rubygems yet, but you can still add it into your Gemfile like so:\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\ngem 'pinocchio', :git => 'http://github.com/justinclayton/pinocchio.git'\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd then execute:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n$ bundle\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Usage\r\n\r\nAdd this to your module's `Rakefile`:\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\nrequire 'pinocchio/rake'\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd this to your module's `features/support/env.rb`:\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\nrequire 'pinocchio'\r\nrequire 'pinocchio/cucumber'\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf you will be testing network connections, you will need to specify what ports to expose to your machine in your `env.rb` as well, like this:\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\nPinocchio.config do |config|\r\n  config.exposed_ports = ['80', '443']\r\nend\r\n```\r\n\r\nLook at the provided test puppet module for a complete example of usage.\r\n\r\n## Assumptions\r\n\r\nPinocchio is a stupid wooden puppet, and therefore makes many assumptions about your workflow:\r\n\r\n\r\n- He assumes you already do spec tests using the `puppetlabs_spec_helper` gem, as he relies on `.fixtures.yml` to understand your module's dependencies. This may change in the future.\r\n\r\n- He doesn't like sharing, so when he downloads and uses Vagrant boxes, they don't go in `$VAGRANT_HOME` (aka `~/.vagrant.d`), but instead in `~/.pinocchio/vagrant_home`. You can override `vagrant_home` and many other config elements inside of the `Pinocchio.config` block.\r\n\r\n- He assumes you like cucumbers. That's why he brought you all these cucumbers. He just wants you to love him!\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
